This package allows you to search any StackExchange site specified in
~asx-sites~ and insert the top post in an Org-mode buffer. For better searching,
this uses Google and DuckDuckGo as it is superior to StackExchange's searching
capabilities. More search engines can be defined using ~asx-search-engine-alist~.

Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cs6cb4/instant_stackoverflow_solutions_in_emacs_without/][this reddit post]] and [[https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-howdoyou][howdoyou.el]], I decided to build a more robust
experience and make it compatible with Org-mode.

I chose to scrape the StackExchange posts, as StackExchange's API only allows
searching/getting posts from a single site.

If Ivy 0.13.0 or Helm is installed, suggestions from Google or DuckDuckGo will
be provided while you type.
